            Rich in resources and presence of highly intellectual minds, the city
of Atlantis developed rapidly.<br>
         Established as the most advanced city in the
world way ahead of its time, the city mysteriously disappeared in the ocean not
to be found.<br>
        As the rest of the world developed relatively slowly over time,
the reason for the demise of the city of Atlantis is getting clearer.<br>
<br>
With the advancement, we are exploiting more and more resources such as trees
and minerals.<br>
        The scarcity of resources which seemed impossible is now the cause
for the modern world to begin collapsing into the sea.<br>
<br>
    Our hero is in the world and is trying to find a way to save the world.<br>
                Your job is to interact with the
    world using our hero and make his misssion possible.<br>
                    
			<br>LET'S SEE IF THE WORLD CAN BE SAVED!!!<br>
