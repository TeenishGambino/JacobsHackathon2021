OPENING:
	Rich in resources and presence of highly intellectual minds, the city
of Atlantis developed rapidly. Established as the most advanced city in the
world way ahead of its time, the city mysteriously disappeared in the ocean not
to be found. As the rest of the world developed relatively slowly over time,
the reason for the demise of the city of Atlantis is getting clearer.

With the advancement, we are exploiting more and more resources such as trees
and minerals. The scarcity of resources which seemed impossible now is the cause
for the modern world to begin collapsing into the sea. Our hero is in the world
and is trying to find a way to save the world. Your job is to interact with the
world using our hero and make his misssion possible.
                    
			LET'S SEE IF YOU CAN!!!
